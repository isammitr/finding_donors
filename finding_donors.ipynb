    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  |  0 | 0 | 1 \n",
    "| 2 |  A    | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most 50,000 USD and those who make more), it is clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

This method is based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and a new approach of feature extraction. Each digit is considered from four different views, and from each view 16 features are extracted and combined to obtain 64 features. Using these features, multiple SVM classifiers are trained to separate different classes of digits.

    " Random Forest.<br>\n",
    "From the above graphs and predictions, it can be seen that Random Forest Classifier and the SVM Classifier give very close accuracy(0.838695(RandomForests) & 0.837148(SVC)) and f_score(0.673585(RandomForests) & 0.674477(SVC)). But the time taken for prediction `pred_time` of the Random Forest Classifier is very less(0.04097) as compared to the SVC(26.256914), hence __Random Forest seems to be the best__, among the chosen three classifiers.<br>\n",
    "Since Random Forest is a group of decision trees, also we want high accuracy because sending letters to the non-donors will cause loss in time and resources and the given data is large, it can be concluded that Random Forest Classifier is suitable for the data."

    "**ANSWER:** <br> Model Explanation : <br>\n",
    "- The final model I have chosen is Random Forest model. Random Forests is an ensemble i.e. a group of decision trees.\n",
    "- A Decision tree is a tree-like structure consisting of nodes and branches where each node represents a feature, each link(branch) represents a decision and each leaf node(i.e. the last node of the tree) represents an outcome(the required prediction).\n",
    "- Thus, using such group decision trees, we get higher accuracy in our prediction model so that the letters can be sent to only the probable donors without wasting any resources.\n",
    "- This(Random Forest Classifier) is a part of Classification technique in Supervised Machine Learning Process where we use labeled data to train the classifier and testing is done further using the trained model. This data classification is a two step process: Learning(Training using Labeled Data) and Classification(Prediction on unlabeled data)\n",
    "    1. __Model Construction__ -- Model Construction is used for describing a set of predetermined classes. Each sample is assumed to belonng to a predefined class, as determined by the class label attribute. Training set is a set of samples. Here, the model is represented as Random Forests. I will explain this step using an __hypothetical example__: Suppose there is company known as \"Starcents\" which has Cafes worldwide hence the quality of the coffee beans used is an important factor to consider. Their team has to decide whether to `select` the current batch of coffee beans or to `do_not_select`. The selection criteria will depend upon various factors like `avg_size_of_bean`, `avg_weight_of_bean`, `colour`, `age`, etc. So a random forest classifier can be built where decisions are taken at each level of the tree and using historical data of either `select`ing or `do_not_select`ing will be used to train the random forest model.\n",
    "    2. __Model Usage__ -- Model Usage is used for classifying future or unknown objects. It estimates an accuracy of the constructed model. The known label of test samples is compared with the classified result from the model trained inn the above step.__Back to our example__: After training the model, when a new batch of coffee beans arrives, the data can be entered as input to the model and checked if the quality matches or not. Thus with high accuracy of Random Forests, it will be beneficial for CharityML to use Random Forest model.<br><br>\n",
    "(To explain the above working I have referred a local textbook I used in my engineering and the example is intuitive. Also the major explanation part is by myself.)"

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- Of the five features discussed in the previous answer, I got three features out of five correct.\n",
    "- As explained before, `age` is an important feature since older a person is, his/her income will be higher and hence more likely to donate. Similar thing is with the `capital-gain` feature, since the person is debt-free and gaining profits, he/she is more likely to donate. The third correct feature was `hours-per-week` showing higher chances of making donations because of higher income.\n",
    "- The two features being seen in the plot and I misinterpreted are `marital-status` and `education-num`. In `education-num` feature, \"Number of educational years completed\" can be seen which shows they have a higher degree of education thus higher income leading to more probability to donate. And it is also seen that people who are married and having families(i.e. people who are well-settled), it seem they are more likely to make donations probably to contribute towards the society.\n",
    "- The other two features I chose are `occupation` and `education-level`. These seem to be quite obvious and common since higher the level in occupation and more a person has been educated, he/she will have higher income and more likely to donate."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
